# How to get started with our code
0. Prerequisites:
- get Node and NPM on your system
  - http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux, http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac, http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows
- get git on your system
  - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
1. If you are on a mac or linnux system, open up terminal. If you are on a PC open Command Prompt.
2. In a browser, go to https://github.com/eecs394-s18/deliberate
3. Click on the clone or download button and click on the copy button or copy the entire link
4. In Terminal or Command Prompt, type "git clone" then space and paste the link (let the files download to your computer)
```git clone https://github.com/eecs394-s18/deliberate.git```
5. Enter the deliberate folder which you just cloned
```cd deliberate```
6. Install required dependencies
```npm install```
7. If you receive an error just google it and stack overflow will be able to resolve any issues with npm install
8. After installing the dependencies successfully, run the deliberate code with
```npm start```
9. A new tab in your browser should appear and that will be a local version of Deliberate likely running on http://localhost:3000/
10. To close the local version of Deliberate go to the Terminal or Command Prompt window and hit the command button and c button at the same time. Also you can close the tab in your browser but doing it in Terminal or Command Prompt is the best way
11. If you would like to reopen Deliberate, you can just type "npm start" into Terminal or Command Prompt only if you are still in the deliberate folder. If you have started a new Terminal or Command Prompt window then you need to navigate back to the deliberate folder in the github folder (how to do this can be found by googling how to navigate to a folder given it's name) and then once in the deliberate folder type "npm start" into Terminal or Command Prompt
